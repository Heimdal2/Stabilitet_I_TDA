As an immediate corollary, we obtain a new proof of the algebraic stability of persistence, a fundamental result in the theory of persistent homology. In contrast to previous proofs, ours shows explicitly how a \${\textbackslash}delta\$-interleaving morphism between two persistence modules induces a \${\textbackslash}delta\$-matching between the barcodes of the two modules. Our main result also specializes to a structure theorem for submodules and quotients of persistence modules, and yields a novel "single-morphism" characterization of the interleaving relation on persistence modules.},

  abstract = {Persistent homology, a central tool of topological data analysis, provides invariants of data called barcodes (also known as persistence diagrams). A barcode is simply a multiset of real intervals. Recent work of Edelsbrunner, Jablonski, and Mrozek suggests an equivalent description of barcodes as functors R -{$>$} Mch, where R is the poset category of real numbers and Mch is the category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are matchings (i.e., partial injective functions). Such functors form a category Mch{\textasciicircum}R whose morphisms are the natural transformations. Thus, this interpretation of barcodes gives us a hitherto unstudied categorical structure on barcodes. The aim of this note is to show that this categorical structure leads to surprisingly simple reformulations of both the well-known stability theorem for persistent homology and a recent generalization called the induced matching theorem.},

To handle such data, one of the methods used is Topological Data Analysis(TDA), which can transform the data, in order to extract and analyze the data. Alzheimer's disease networks show the changes that happen in the brain network as the disease progresses. Methods should be devised to capture these changes efficiently. In this work, two powerful tools of Topological data analysis, ``persistent homology'' and ``mapper algorithm'' are applied on the disease networks to gain insights about the changes happening during onset and progression of the disease. From the results, it can be concluded that more fragmentation is happening within the brain network as the disease progresses. The interconnections within the community(or cluster) are stronger as compared to the connections with other communities(or clusters). This may lead to difficulties in various cognitive functions such as attention, memory, language, and problem-solving.},

However, neither is robust to outliers, and both can be insensitive to topological structure of high-density regions of the data. A natural solution is to consider 2-parameter persistence. This paper studies the stability of 2-parameter persistent homology: We show that several related density-sensitive constructions of bifiltrations from data satisfy stability properties accommodating the addition and removal of outliers. Specifically, we consider the multicover bifiltration, Sheehy's subdivision bifiltrations, and the degree bifiltrations. For the multicover and subdivision bifiltrations, we get 1-Lipschitz stability results closely analogous to the standard stability results for 1-parameter persistent homology. Our results for the degree bifiltrations are weaker, but they are tight, in a sense. As an application of our theory, we prove a law of large numbers for subdivision bifiltrations of random data.},

This generalizes the standard notion of rank invariant as well as Patel's recent extension. Specifically, the barcode of any interval decomposable persistence modules F : P {$\rightarrow$} vec of finite dimensional vector spaces can be extracted from the rank invariant by the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Generalizing this idea allows freedom of choosing the indexing poset P of F : P {$\rightarrow$} C in defining Patel's generalized persistence diagram of F. Of particular importance is the fact that the generalized persistence diagram of F is defined regardless of whether F is interval decomposable or not. By specializing our idea to zigzag persistence modules, we also show that the zeroth level set barcode of a Reeb graph can be obtained in a purely set-theoretic setting without passing to the category of vector spaces. This leads to a promotion of Patel's semicontinuity theorem about type A persistence diagram to Lipschitz continuity theorem for the category of sets.},

The definitions of -interleavings and dI generalize readily to multidimensional persistence modules. In this paper, we develop the theory of multidimensional interleavings, with a view toward applications to topological data analysis. We present four main results. First, we show that on 1-D persistence modules, dI is equal to the bottleneck distance dB. This result, which first appeared in an earlier preprint of this paper, has since appeared in several other places, and is now known as the isometry theorem. Second, we present a characterization of the -interleaving relation on multidimensional persistence modules. This expresses transparently the sense in which two -interleaved modules are algebraically similar. Third, using this characterization, we show that when we define our persistence modules over a prime field, dI satisfies a universality property. This universality result is the central result of the paper. It says that dI satisfies a stability property generalizing one which dB is known to satisfy, and that in addition, if d is any other pseudometric on multidimensional persistence modules satisfying the same stability property, then d {$\leq$} dI. We also show that a variant of this universality result holds for dB, over arbitrary fields. Finally, we show that dI restricts to a metric on isomorphism classes of finitely presented multidimensional persistence modules.},

This is done by representing some aspect of the structure of the data in a simplified topological signature. In this article, we introduce two of the most commonly used topological signatures. First, the persistence diagram represents loops and holes in the space by considering connectivity of the data points for a continuum of values rather than a single fixed value. The second topological signature, the mapper graph, returns a 1-dimensional structure representing the shape of the data, and is particularly good for exploration and visualization of the data. While these techniques are based on very sophisticated mathematics, the current ubiquity of available software means that these tools are more accessible than ever to be applied to data by researchers in education and learning, as well as all domain scientists.},

  abstract = {We present a new, inductive construction of the Vietoris-Rips complex, in which we take advantage of a small amount of unexploited combinatorial structure in the k-skeleton of the complex in order to avoid unnecessary comparisons when identifying its (k + 1)-simplices. In doing so, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of comparisons required to construct the Vietoris-Rips compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, which is seen here by examining the computational complexity of the critical step in the algorithms. In experiments comparing a C/C++ implementation of our algorithm to the GUDHI v3.9.0 software package [5], this results in an observed 5-10-fold improvement in speed of on sufficiently sparse Erd{\textacutedbl}os-R{\textasciiacute}enyi graphs with the best advantages as the graphs become sparser, as well as for higher dimensional Vietoris-Rips complexes. We further clarify that the algorithm described in [2] for the construction of the Vietoris-Rips complex is exactly the Incremental Algorithm from [9], albeit with the additional requirement that the result be stored in a tree structure, and we explain how these techniques are different from the algorithm presented here.},

  abstract = {Information in the cortex is thought to be represented by the joint activity of neurons. Here we describe how fundamental questions about neural representation can be cast in terms of the topological structure of population activity. A new method, based on the concept of persistent homology, is introduced and applied to the study of population activity in primary visual cortex (V1). We found that the topological structure of activity patterns when the cortex is spontaneously active is similar to those evoked by natural image stimulation and consistent with the topology of a two sphere. We discuss how this structure could emerge from the functional organization of orientation and spatial frequency maps and their mutual relationship. Our findings extend prior results on the relationship between spontaneous and evoked activity in V1 and illustrates how computational topology can help tackle elementary questions about the representation of information in the nervous system.},

We formulate a two-phase approach for its construction that separates geometry from topology. We survey methods for the first phase, give three algorithms for the second phase, implement all algorithms, and present experimental results. Our software can also be used for constructing any clique complex, such as the weak witness complex.},
